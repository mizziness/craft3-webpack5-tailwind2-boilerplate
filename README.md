## Craft CMS 3 Boilerplate
**(with Webpack 5, Tailwind 2, PostCSS 8, and HMR, and other goodies)**

A real-world boilerplate for Craft CMS 3 projects that leverages Wepback 5, Tailwind 2, PostCSS 8, and Twigpack. Also included is a hot-reload dev environment. I created this as a starting point for Craft CMS 3 / Webpack 5 projects.

### What's Included

* [Craft CMS 3](https://github.com/craftcms/cms) - My CMS of choice, and the app which will consume assets from Webpack.

* [Twigpack](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-twigpack) - The bridge between Craft CMS and Webpack
* [TailwindCSS 2](https://tailwindcss.com) - Awesome CSS framework that makes dev speedy

### Get Started

First, finish up installing Craft CMS locally for your development environment. There is a temporary license key included by default to prevent an error during installation. It will get overwritten by a new one:

```
$ composer install
$ ./craft setup
```

Then install our other packages and run the HMR development server:

```
$ yarn install
$ yarn dev
```
(I use `yarn` for my project, but you don't need to - use the tool of your choice.)

Webpack assets are set up to serve from `localhost:8080` by default.  

*Note:* The URL "http://localhost:8080" won't show anything by default, but you can check http://localhost:8080/app.bundle.js to make sure things are running.  If you prefer to have a page load, though, you can edit `wpconfig/webpack.common.js` and uncomment the `new HtmlWebpackPlugin` code block. This will generate an `index.html` file along with your assets.

You can include your chunked/hashed assets in Craft CMS templates by using [Twigpack](https://nystudio107.com/docs/twigpack/)'s features:

```
{{ craft.twigpack.includeCssModule("app.css", true) }}
{{ craft.twigpack.includeJsModule("app.js", true, {"type": "module"}) }}
{{ craft.twigpack.includeJsModule("chunk-vendors.js", true) }}
```

### Scripts

As you can see in the `package.json` file, there are 3 included scripts for convenience:

* `yarn dev` - Runs the HMR development server
* `yarn build` - Creates a production-ready build for deployment (asset output is in `web/dist`)
* `yarn clean` - A quick way to clear Craft CMS caches while you code


### Make it Yours

This project comes pre-configured out of the box to work with Craft CMS templates, but there are plenty of ways you can customize the way this works to suit your own needs.  It tries to make no assumptions about your toolkit, other than the minimum required configuration to work with the tools included.

- Tailwind has been set up with with a default configuration, and I highly suggest modifying it for your project. (You can overwrite it with an existing `tailwind.config.js` file, if you have one, to import all your custom styling quickly.)
- devServer options can be changed and extended as needed - for example, by default auto `open` for the served url is turned off, but if you're using a custom generated template, then you might want it on, instead.
- Go to town!

### Prettier Webpack

If you're like me and you prefer a cleaner webpack report, try this:

`yarn add webpackbar -D`

In the `wpconfig` files, you'll see two commented-out lines which you can uncomment to enable a much nicer view of your webpack report with [webpackbar](https://github.com/nuxt-contrib/webpackbar).
